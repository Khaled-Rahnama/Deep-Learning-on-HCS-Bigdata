# Deep-Learning-on-HCS-Bigdata
High Content Screening (HCS) technologies that combine automated fluorescence microscopy with high throughput biotechnology
have become powerful systems for studying cell biology and drug screening. These systems can produce more than 100 000 images per
day, making their success dependent on automated image analysis. HCS experiments can contain tens of thousands of images, including
millions of cells. Researchers have to utilize Artificial Intelligence algorithms to classify or cluster cells that they cannot evaluate manually.

In this work, we are interested in the application and provision of cutting-edge machine learning algorithms for HCS data analysis, which are tailored to suit its specific conditions and challenges. This research focuses on the challenge of using information content that is as high as possible, by considering per-cell information and all the available features, to build a system for high content analysis. Our research will be done on cells' images.

The final version of the code will be released after publishing papers.
